👋 Hello, GitHub folks! Here's a Senior Developer with over 20 years in the fascinating world of technology. I love creating creative web solutions, mobile apps, and REST APIs that are as reliable as your morning coffee. My favorite tools? ASP.NET, Angular, React, Django, and of course, a lot of C#, Kotlin, NodeJs, TypeScript, and Python.

📚 Beyond the world of technology, I am a student of philosophy, always exploring the big questions of the world and how they intertwine with technological innovation. Philosophy helps me to think outside the box and bring a unique perspective to software development.

🌐 At AWS, I enjoy playing with the cloud to create solutions that not only scale well but are also super secure. I am an enthusiast of system architecture and always in search of well-made and elegant code.

🤹‍♂️ I'm a veteran of agile methods and a Scrum master. My approach is always to solve problems with critical and creative thinking. And of course, I don't forget about testing - from unit to functional, to ensure that everything is top-notch!

☕ Besides technology and philosophy, I am a great coffee connoisseur. I believe that a good coffee is the perfect fuel for creativity and long coding sessions. Whether discussing ideas or debugging code, you'll always find me with a cup of coffee nearby.

📈 With experience in various sectors, such as education, automotive, and finance, I am always ready for new challenges and learning, maintaining excellence in what I do. I strongly believe in the power of collaboration and effective communication for the success of the team.

🚀 Driven by passion in technology and always in pursuit of improvement, here on GitHub, I'm always ready for new adventures and challenges. Let's code!
